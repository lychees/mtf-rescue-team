== Name

easyrpg-player - Interpreter for RPG Maker 2000/2003 games


== Synopsis

*easyrpg-player* [<optional flags>...]


== Description

EasyRPG Player is an open source interpreter for RPG Maker 2000 and 2003 games.
It aims to support all features of unmodified games and also has some support
for some additional binary patches.


== Options

*--battle-test* 'MONSTERPARTY'::
  Starts a battle test with the specified monster party.

*--disable-audio*::
  Disable audio (in case you prefer your own music).

*--disable-rtp*::
  Disable support for the Runtime Package (RTP). Will lead to checkerboard
  graphics and silent music/sound effects in games depending on the RTP.

*--encoding* 'ENCODING'::
  Instead of auto detecting the encoding or using the one in RPG_RT.ini, the
  specified encoding is used. Use "auto" for automatic detection.

*--engine* 'ENGINE'::
  Disable auto detection of the simulated engine. Possible options:
   - 'rpg2k'      - RPG Maker 2000 engine (v1.00 - v1.10)
   - 'rpg2kv150'  - RPG Maker 2000 engine (v1.50 - v1.51)
   - 'rpg2ke'     - RPG Maker 2000 (English release) engine (v1.61)
   - 'rpg2k3'     - RPG Maker 2003 engine (v1.00 - v1.04)
   - 'rpg2k3v105' - RPG Maker 2003 engine (v1.05 - v1.09a)
   - 'rpg2k3e'    - RPG Maker 2003 (English release) engine

*--fullscreen*::
  Start in fullscreen mode.

*--show-fps*::
  Enable frames per second counter.

*--fps-render-window*::
  Render the frames per second counter in both full screen and windowed mode.

*--fps-limit*::
  Set a custom frames per second limit. If unspecified, the default is 60 fps.
  Set to 0 to disable the frame limiter. This option may not be supported on
  all platforms.

*--no-vsync*::
  Disable vsync and use fps-limit. Vsync may or may not be supported on all
  platforms. Check the engine log to verify whether or not vsync actually is
  being used.

*--enable-mouse*::
  Use mouse click for decision and scroll wheel for lists.

*--enable-touch*::
  Use one/two finger tap for decision/cancel.

*--hide-title*::
  Hide the title background image and center the command menu.

*--load-game-id* 'ID'::
  Skip the title scene and load Save__ID__.lsd ('ID' is padded to two digits).

*--new-game*::
  Skip the title scene and start a new game directly.

*--project-path* 'PATH'::
  Instead of using the working directory the game in 'PATH' is used.

*--rtp-path* 'PATH'::
  Adds 'PATH' to the RTP directory list and use this one with highest
  precedence.

*--record-input* 'PATH'::
  Records all button input to a log file at 'PATH'.

*--replay-input* 'PATH'::
  Replays button input from a log file at 'PATH', as generated by
  **--record-input**. If the RNG seed (**--seed**) and the state of the save
  file directory is also the same as it was when the log was recorded, this
  should reproduce an identical run to the one recorded.

*--save-path* 'PATH'::
  Instead of storing save files in the game directory they are stored in
  'PATH'. The directory must exist.

NOTE: When using the game browser all games will share the same save
directory!

*--seed* 'SEED'::
  Seeds the random number generator.

*--autobattle-algo* 'ALGO'::
  Which AutoBattle algorithm to use. Possible options:
   - 'RPG_RT'     - The default RPG_RT compatible algo, including RPG_RT bugs
   - 'RPG_RT+'    - The default RPG_RT compatible algo, with bug fixes

*--enemyai-algo* 'ALGO'::
  Which EnemyAI algorithm to use. Possible options:
   - 'RPG_RT'     - The default RPG_RT compatible algo, including RPG_RT bugs
   - 'RPG_RT+'    - The default RPG_RT compatible algo, with bug fixes

*--patch* 'PATCH_A' ['PATCH_B' '...']::
  Force emulation of engine patches, disabling auto detection.

   - 'none'       - Disable all patches
   - 'dynrpg'     - DynRPG patch by Cherry
   - 'maniac'     - Maniac Patch by BingShan

  padded to four digits).

NOTE: Incompatible with *--load-game-id*.

*--start-party* 'A' ['B' '...']::
  Overwrite the starting party members with the actors with IDs 'A', 'B', '...'

NOTE: Incompatible with *--load-game-id*.

*--language* 'LANG'::
  Loads the game translation in language/'LANG' folder.

*--soundfont* 'FILE'::
  Adds 'FILE' to the list of soundfonts used for playing MIDI files and use
  this one with highest precedence. The soundfont must be in SF2 format.

== Environment

'RPG2K_RTP_PATH'::
  Full path to a directory containing an extracted RPG Maker 2000
  Run-Time-Package(RTP).

'RPG2K3_RTP_PATH'::
  Full path to a directory containing an extracted RPG Maker 2003 RTP.

'RPG_RTP_PATH'::
  Full path to a directory containing a combined RTP.

NOTE: All '*_RTP_PATH' variables support directory lists, using colon (':') or
semicolon (';') as separator. Useful when you have multiple translated RTP
versions or directories with extra files. The '--rtp-path' command line
option supports directory lists as well.

'SDL_SOUNDFONTS'::
  List of soundfonts in sf2 format to use when playing MIDI files. The first
  existing soundfont is used.

NOTE: Use colon (':') or semicolon (';') as separator. Use '--soundfont'
to specify a soundfont on the command line.


== Files

'RPG_RT.ini'::
  The game configuration file. It follows a simple *Key*='Value' syntax in
  multiple sections. Specific options can be set in the [EasyRPG] section.
  For example:
----
[EasyRPG]
Encoding=1252
----
  This will set the correct encoding for most english games.

NOTE: Values in the configuration file will overwrite auto detected ones,
however command line parameters will take precedence.
