This font is EasyRPG ttyp0, a font based on UW ttyp0, version 1.3.

It covers most of the Latin and Cyrillic alphabet, Greek, Armenian,
Georgian (only Mkhedruli), Hebrew (without cantillation marks),
Thai, most of IPA (but no UPA), standard punctuation, common
symbols, some mathematics, line graphics and a few dingbats (about
3000 Unicode characters).

You can download the original font here:

EasyRPGâ€™s ttyp0 only has a regular 6x12 version.

To compile ttyp0 into C++ files, a generate_cxx_font.rb inside ../shinonome/
is used. This is due to historical reasons (Shinonome was the first font
added to EasyRPG) and should be changed in the future.
