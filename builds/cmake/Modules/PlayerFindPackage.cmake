# PlayerFindPackage
# -----------------
#
# Helper function that conditionally invokes find_package and automatically
# adds targets and compile time definitions.
#
# Required Arguments
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# ``NAME`` (String)
#   Name of the library to search. The name must match FindNAME.cmake.
# ``TARGET`` (String)
#   Target to import when the library was found.
#
# Optional Arguments
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# ``CONDITION`` (Bool)
#   When this variable is set to OFF the package is skipped.
#   Allows disabling of libraries via the CMake command line.
# ``DEFINITION`` (String)
#   Preprocessor definition which is set to 1 when the library was found.
# ``FOUND`` (String)
#   Specifies the variable name of the FOUND variable that is checked.
#   When missing, the variable is the ``NAME`` argument in upper case.
# ``REQUIRED`` (without arguments)
#   The library is required. Forwarded to find_package.
# ``VERSION`` (String)
#   Specifies required version of the library.
#
# Return variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# ``NAME_FOUND``
#   Set to TRUE when the library was found. NAME is the ``NAME`` argument in
#   upper case or the ``FOUND`` argument when specified.
